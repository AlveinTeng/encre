# Type alias: BuiltInNodeTypePairs

> **BuiltInNodeTypePairs**: *typeof* `globalNodeRegistry.registeredNodeTypePairs`

Represents the mapping of each built-in node type to its corresponding subtypes. This type is crucial for
understanding and accessing the full structure of node types within the system. It is used in contexts where
operations depend on the subtype of a node, such as during node creation or when performing type-specific
logic.
